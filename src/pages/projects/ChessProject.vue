            At work I spent days trying to fix a feature, only to realize that I
            was working on the incorrect problem — #[em twice]. I knew that I had
            some mental biases when problem solving or playing carom but, I didn't
            realize that it would be so serious. So to develop my mental aptitude
            and to discover my mental biases, I decided to learn to play Chess.
        p.
            I know the rules of Chess. I don't know how to play Chess. Bored of 
            languishing during The Lockdown, I had tried to get into Chess a couple
            of times before. I always gave up early. I just didn't understand
            Chess.

        h2.text-2xl Day 1: Puzzles
        p.
            This time I wanted to be prepared before I went into the battlefield.
            I revived my account (surprisingly, created just a month ago) and started
            solving puzzles. I lost ~300 points after failing to solve the first couple
            of puzzles. But, I kept going. 
        p.
            After a while, to my surprise and joy, I had a blast solving puzzles.
            I blundered a lot but, I was able to solve a lot more than I expected.
            Staying up late, I attempted 77 Puzzles.

        h2.text-2xl Day 2: Getting Obliterated
        p.
            After my initial boost of confidence. I was ready to tackle real players.
            Or so, I thought. I got obliterated in all the 10 Rapid Games that I played.
        p.
            I have a long way to go.
    section
        h2.text-2xl Week 1: Practice
        p.
            I had to work on my basics so I started learning through the Practice and Study
            sections at #[code Lichess]. I played (and got obliterated) a few times.
        p.
            Puzzles are much harder to solve now. I stay around in the 1100-1300 puzzle rating 
            range.
    section
        h2.text-2xl First Win
        p.
            I have realized that my game opening is really weak. But, I couldn't find a good source
            to practice it. I found the #[a(href="https://lichess.org/opening" target="_blank") Lichess Opening Explorer]
            a bit difficult to go through. I watched a few YouTube videos on the 
            #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_System" target="_blank") London System] for White
            and the #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caro%E2%80%93Kann_Defence" target="_blank") Caro–Kann]
            Defense for Black. I tried them with little success.
        p.
            In a #[a(href="https://lichess.org/study/lqZ0CBHF" target="_blank") study], Vidar Grahn
            a Swedish FM suggested #[a(href="https://chessbook.com/" target="_blank") ChessBook]. After
            going through it I though it was neat and affordable so, I bought it.
        p.
            The first path that I learned was the most popular one: 
            #[code e4-e5] — the #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Pawn_Game" target="_blank") King's Pawn Game].
            There were many openings to choose from and I chose the top most one which is the 
            #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruy_Lopez" target="_blank") Ruy Lopez]. I went
            through a lot of the paths and was confident enough to attempt a match.
        p.
            I waited some time for an opponent, only to be playing Black. I felt bad but, I left the match.
            I won't do that again. The second time, I was white. I played the Ruy. And won! My opponent resigned.
            My first upward bump in the rating chart. My first win in chess with a stranger. Today is a good
            day! Due credits go to #[a(href="https://chessbook.com") ChessBook](not sponsored).
    section
        h2.text-2xl Blunder King
        p.
            I lost a ton of matches. It was because I was blundering pieces left and right.
            It was because I moved #[em fast]. I would blunder and resign within the first 2-3 minutes of a Rapid Game.
            I was playing as if I was a Blitz Champion.
        p
            | Once I slowed down and took my time, careful so as to not blunder I was able to win 3 matches in a row!
